# win-cmd-tools
Collection of some Windows commandline tools/batch scripts I use on a daily-ish basis.

Some I use via the send-to menu in Explorer, others I have on the desktop for drag'n'drop usage.

This repo assumes you know how to install the various needed applications for the batch files, and/or how to link them for usage, eg. via environment variables. If not, read up about it on http://ss64.com/
